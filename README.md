Bees Algorithm

This tutorial is about a basic form of Bees Algorithm.
The Bees Algorithm is a population-based nature-inspired search algorithm, that mimics the food foraging behaviour of swarms of honey bees. 
It performs a kind of neighbourhood search combined with random search and it can be used for both combinatorial optimisation and functional optimisation.
